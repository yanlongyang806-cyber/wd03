h4.SupportedLanguages (string) - (AccessLevel 9) [Notes|Command_SupportedLanguages_ServerLib]
This setting is a comma separated list of short (2 character) language codes that are supported by this shard. We reject logins at the LoginServer and GameServer from clients (AL < 4)
with a language not in this list. If empty, we support all incoming languages.
