h3.AIAggroDef

*Counter* (multiple allowed)
-	list of counters to be processed

*\{*
-	*name* < string >
--	used primarily for debug displaying
-	*counterType* < Expression | COUNT > [#AIAggroCounterType]

--	damage: uses the damage counter
--	threat: uses the threat counter
--	healing: uses the healing counter
--	expression: uses the given expr
-	*targetType* < self | friends | COUNT > [#AINotifyTargetType]

--	Self: anything done to me
--	Friends: anything done to teammates
-	*ExprBlock*
--	If the counterType is 'expression' this is the expression that will be evaluated to get the counter value
-	*postScale* < float >
--	scale applied to the counter to calculate the aggro value
-	*ExprDecayRateBlock*
--	the decay deducted from the counter every AI tick (~0.5 seconds)
-	*decayDelay* < float >
--	the time since the counterType was last touched before decay will kick in
-	*enabled*
--	if this field is enabled or not, defaults to enabled

*\}*

*Gauge* (multiple allowed)
-	list of gauges to be processed

*\{*
-	*name* < string >
--	used primarily for debug displaying
-	*gaugeType* < Distance | Sticky | Expression > [#AIAggroGaugeType]

--	controls what the gauge uses to calculate it's value. 
--	Distance: Uses a normalized ratio of current distance over aggro radius
--	Sticky: if the entity is our current target apply the sticky value, otherwise do not.
--	Expression: evaluates the given expression
-	*ExprBlock*
--	If the gaugeType is 'Expression' this is the expression that will be evaluated to get the gauge value
-	*postScale* < float >
--	after the gauge is calculated, the scale applied to the gauge value
-	*scaleType* < Counter | PostCounters | PostAll | MaxTotalCounter > [#AIAggroGaugeScaleType]

--	controls how the final aggro value is calculated from the gauge value. 
--	Counter: multiplies the result gauge value by the given scaleTargetType / scaleCounterType
--	PostCounters: multiplies the result gauge value by the sum of all counters
--	PostAll: multiplies the result gauge by the sum of all the counters and gauges processed up to that point. These PostAll gauges are processed in order.
--	MaxTotalCounter: multiplies the result gauge by the maximum counter total from all the entities a critter has aggro on
-	*scaleCounterType* < Expression | COUNT > [#AIAggroCounterType]

--	if the scaleType is Counter
--	damage: uses the damage counter
--	threat: uses the threat counter
--	healing: uses the healing counter
-	*scaleTargetType* < self | friends | COUNT > [#AINotifyTargetType]

--	valid only if scaleType is Counter
--	Self: anything done to me
--	Friends: anything done to teammates
-	*enabled*
--	if this field is enabled or not, defaults to enabled

*\}*

*initialPullThreat* < int >
-	if non-zero, when an encounter is first aggroed, this value will be applied to every critter in that
-	encounter to the entity that initiated the aggro

*powerMissedThreat* < int >
-	if non-zero, when a Power misses, this value will be applied to the target as "THREAT" to the entity
-	that used the Power

*MeleeRange* < float >
-	when evaluating the distance gauge, any distance less than this value will count as a full gauge value

*TimeSinceSpawnToIgnoreHealing* < float >
-	the time after a critter has spawned that it will start accruing healing aggro

*scaleHealingByLegalTargets*
-	scales the healing aggro among the entities that have the target on their status table.
-	Example: If there are 5 enemies and you heal for 500, then each enemy receives 100 healing aggro

*separateHealingByAttackTarget*
-	if true, separates healing done to an entity's current heal target from healing done to something that isn't its target
-	healing done to the current target goes into targetType: AI_NOTIFY_TARGET_SELF
-	healing done to an entity that isn't the current target goes into targetType: AI_NOTIFY_TARGET_FRIENDS
