WARNING: Returns the distance between the current entity and the geometric average of the ent
array passed in ignoring height. See comment at DistToEnts()

using it

One of the more useful ways to use this function is accessing data through object paths starting
with targetEnt.
In general please try to use a more specific function if it's available, as this function can
be quite expensive.
Example: GetProxEnts().EntCropExpr(\{targetEnt.name = "Bob"\})
